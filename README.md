## Planning

---

Since the last project I rushed things to meet the 26th of march deadline I will
instead aim for the July deadline to be more prepared and work around my life.

These requirements seem like a simple layout meaning a heading and many cards in
a row and collapsing to a column when a certain size is reached on the viewport.

I will keep this simple as I think it is focused on CSS flexbox and JS
fundamentals.

Should have commited small chunks of code when completing the base styling and
JS. Did JS flexbox in one commit instead of two.

Design not create it follows a generic card design

## Building

---

1. Set up scaffoling boilerplate files and HTML

2. Create Cards using flexbox

3. Responsiveness using media queries

4. Single column on mobile devices

5. Clickable button which opens and closes description text
