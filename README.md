# Project Gallery

## Requirements

---

1. Have a section or card for each project

2. Each card should have a title, an image of your project, and a description

3. Use flexbox to arrange the cards on the page

4. Resize cards based on screen width

5. Adapt the layout of the gallery when the browser window resizes

6. Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices

7. Have a clickable button on each card that opens and closes the description
   text

## Planning

---

Since the last project, I rushed to meet the deadline on the 26th of March. I
will instead aim for the July deadline to be more prepared and work around my
life.

These requirements are a simple layout meaning a heading and many cards in a
row, and collapsing to a column when a specific size is reached on the viewport.

I will keep this simple as I think it is focused on CSS flexbox and JS
fundamentals.

I should have committed small chunks of code when completing the base styling
and JS. For example, I did JS flexbox in one commit instead of two separate
commits.

Design not create it follows a generic card design

I only have one project, as this is the second one. Therefore, I am unsure how
to show more projects as I only have one.

Usually, I would compress images and upload them to a website, but since this
will only have a few, the image loading shouldn't affect load times too much.

## Building

---

1. Set up scaffoling boilerplate files and HTML

2. Create Cards using flexbox

3. Responsiveness using media queries

4. Single column on mobile devices

5. Clickable button which opens and closes description text
